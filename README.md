# 523-24s-techtalk
- For our Software Engineering Lab course we have to prepare a tech talk and this repo contains our preparations for a tech talk and introductory demo on React Native 

# Script
## Getting Started (Nupur)
We will be using Expo Go to simulate our app. Make sure you have Node.js installed and Expo Go downloaded on your phone. We will be using an iPhone simulator we downloaded from Xcode on our MacBooks. We recommend using VSCode for the purposes of this demo. We will be working in a repository we created but feel free to make your own repository or a new folder. Its up to you how you want to organize it!

1. Open up your terminal and run the command below and replace DemoApp with what you'd like to call your own app: 

npx create-expo-app DemoApp

2. Open up the folder that should have been created in VSCode and also make sure to change directories in your terminal by running cd DemoApp

3. run "npx expo start" in your terminal and follow the instructions to simulate the app. Whenever you reopen your project make sure to run npx expo start so you can simulate the project. 

4. Open up App.js to start working on your app! Also sometimes the simulator takes some time before it loads, patience is key. 

## React Native Core Components Basics (Nupur)

- For our sample app we will be taking inspiration from Amanda and I's PearlHacks project that we worked on along with our friend Lydia 
- Right Now, the starter code is pretty blank so let's play around with some of React Native's Core Components 
- start with a view and show why we want to containerize in a View by starting with text right away 
- StatusBar, then Text, Image, TextInput
- side note but a very important one! - React Native makes it really easy to use accesibility feautures! 
- This is a great place to get started but of course apps we want to produce we want to make them look prettier! I'm going to hand it off to Amanda now to cover  integral aspects of an app like Buttons and the ability to scroll!
