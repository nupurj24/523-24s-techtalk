# 523-24s-techtalk
- For our Software Engineering Lab course we have to prepare a tech talk and this repo contains our preparations for a tech talk and introductory demo on React Native 

## Getting Started 
We will be using Expo Go to simulate our app. Make sure you have Node.js installed and Expo Go downloaded on your phone. We will be using an iPhone simulator we downloaded from Xcode on our MacBooks. We recommend using VSCode for the purposes of this demo. We will be working in a repository we created but feel free to make your own repository or a new folder. Its up to you how you want to organize it!

1. Open up your terminal and run the command below and replace DemoApp with what you'd like to call your own app: 

npx create-expo-app DemoApp

2. Open up the folder that should have been created in VSCode and also make sure to change directories in your terminal by running cd DemoApp

3. run "npx expo start" in your terminal and follow the instructions to simulate the app. Whenever you reopen your project make sure to run npx expo start so you can simulate the project. 

4. Open up App.js to start working on your app! Also sometimes the simulator takes some time before it loads, patience is key.
